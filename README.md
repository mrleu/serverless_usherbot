This is for ignite usage only. It's an usher bot that you can talk to through sms message. It sends cron jbo to alert for ushering notification, and if you're busy, it'll ask the next person.

On the backend, it's built with Twilio, AWS lambda, AWS API gateway, and
Google Sheet for I/O.

If you have any questions, consult mr.leu.
